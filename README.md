# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction (Random Forest)

This project applies **Random Forest Regression** to estimate housing prices in California using demographic and housing attributes such as median income, population density, and household features.

---

## 📌 Project Summary
We use the **California Housing dataset** (originally from the 1990 U.S. Census, available on Kaggle/Scikit-learn) to build a machine learning model that predicts the median home values across California. The focus is on feature exploration, preprocessing, and model optimization for accurate predictions.

   - Load dataset  
   - Inspect data structure  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize feature distributions  
   - Study correlations between variables  
   - Map-based insights using latitude/longitude  

3. **Preprocessing**
   - Train-test split  
   - Feature scaling (where required)  

4. **Model Development**
   - Random Forest Regressor as the core algorithm  
   - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - R² Score
